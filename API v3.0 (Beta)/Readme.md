# Introduction:
In our anomaly detection process, we've implemented a specific approach using clustering techniques to efficiently identify anomalies within our dataset. This approach allows us to detect unusual patterns or outliers that deviate significantly from the expected behavior. While the initial technique we used, Isolation Forest, didn't yield satisfactory results for our specific anomalies, we decided to switch to a different algorithm called Local Outlier Factor (LoF) for improved performance.

# Approach Explanation:
Our approach involves applying various clustering techniques to different features in our dataset, enabling us to pinpoint specific types of anomalies effectively. Let's dive into the details of each clustering technique and how it contributes to the efficient detection of anomalies.

1. *User ID and Hours:*
We examine the login times associated with each user ID. By analyzing patterns, we can detect instances where users log in outside their usual time frames. This allows us to identify anomalies related to irregular login behavior.

2. *Country and Hours:*
Considering the login times of users from different countries, we can identify suspicious login times associated with specific countries. This clustering technique helps us flag anomalies in login behavior on a country-level basis.

3. *IP Address and Country Code:*
By comparing the IP address of a user with the associated country code, we can identify cases where the IP address does not match the expected country. This helps us detect potential instances of IP address spoofing or incorrect location mapping.

4. *IP Address and Region Code:*
Anomalies related to changes in the user's location are detected by comparing the IP address with the region code. If the user's location seems to have changed, we consider it an anomaly worth investigating.

5. *IP Address and City Code:*
Similar to the previous technique, we compare the IP address with the city code to detect anomalies associated with changes in the user's city. This helps us identify potential cases where the user's location has shifted.

6. *IP Address and Login Successful:*
This technique focuses on identifying anomalies based on unsuccessful login attempts from a specific network. By examining the IP address and the login success rate, we can detect instances where there are an unusually high number of unsuccessful login attempts originating from a particular IP address.

7. *Country and Browser Name/Version Code:*
We compare the country with the browser name and version code to identify anomalies related to outdated or suspicious browsers. This technique helps us flag instances where users are using browsers that are considered outdated or have a suspicious reputation.

8. *Country and Device Type Code:*
By examining the country and the device type code, we can identify anomalies associated with rare device usage in a specific country. This helps us detect instances where a particular device is seldom used in a particular country, indicating potential anomalies.

*Efficiency of the Code:*
Our code efficiently detects anomalies by applying these clustering techniques to the dataset. By focusing on specific features and leveraging clustering algorithms, we can narrow down our analysis and quickly identify instances of interest. Each technique targets a specific aspect of the data, allowing us to efficiently pinpoint anomalies and flag them for further investigation.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, our anomaly detection approach combines multiple clustering techniques to effectively identify anomalies in our dataset. Although the initial technique, Isolation Forest, did not provide satisfactory results for our specific anomalies, we decided to switch to the LoF algorithm. By following this approach, we can efficiently detect anomalies related to login times, IP addresses, countries, browsers, and device types. This allows us to identify unusual patterns and outliers that require further scrutiny and investigation.
